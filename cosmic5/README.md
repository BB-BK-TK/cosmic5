# Moved to repo root

This app was moved to the project root (`c:\myProject`) so Vercel can build without a Root Directory.

**Use the app at the repo root:** run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` from `c:\myProject`.

You can delete this `cosmic5` folder manually when no process is using it (close dev server, then remove the folder).
